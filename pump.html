  <h1>Pumping cylinder below grade</h1>
   <p>Why- So the pump head does not freeze. Alternatively, to pump from greater depths.</p>
   <p>A pitcher pump works with suction. All the mechachial/moving parts are in the pump head. It depends on an airtight seal between the plunger and the cylinder wall. And then, that the pipe all the way down to the water table is airtight.</p>
  <p>This modification extends the drive rod of a pitcher pump 5 feet. A new cylinder is fabricated. The flapper valve is discarded (a foot valve does the same job).</p>
  <p>At the <a href="pump.html">bottom</a> of the page you can find a parts list, references, and a few more details.</p>

  <h1>Plunger fits in 3" DWV pipe</h1>
  <p>Took  awhile hunting for something that had the right inside diameter(ID). The cast iron ID is measured to 2.95inches. This doesn't have to be incredibly precise because when the leather is wet it swells up. In fact, it feels pretty loose when dry.</p>
  <p> The only two materials I could find that had this ID were PVC and copper. Although copper can be pricey at this diamter, you need less than a foot. I have concerns that PVC may wear poorly over time</p>

  <h1>Cylinder ends</h1>
  <p>A 3">1-1/4" reducer is brazed to a short piece of 1-1/4" copper pipe which is brazed to a 1-1/4" threaded adapter.</p>
  <p> First time brazing, hopefully they look more consitent next time :)</p>

  <h1>All brazed</h1>
  <p>The plunger must be inside the new cylinder before brazing on the last reducer. Make sure the leather end of the plunger is as far away from the heat as it can be. Servicing the leather may be hard. Guys at the plumbing shop said that you can unbraze pipe pretty easily. But I think on a 3in pipe with a small torch that might not work.</p>

  <h1>Attaching the drop tube</h1>
  <p>Poly pipe is dropped into the well for the remaining depth. I dont trust pvc barbed fittings at this diamter so I use galvanised. Ideally the threaded reducer between the zinc and copper would be galvanically isolated. Those fancy ones are absurdly expensive. So I just figured this piece would need to be replaced every 2 years. But, I now think I will just replace it with a $1 threaded PVC reducer. The barbed fitting will still be zinc.</p>
