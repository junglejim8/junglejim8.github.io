  <h1>Build</h1>
  <p>This page is about an earth bermed cabin I built in 2015. I've now lived in it for a year :) </p>
  <p>Hope you enjoy the read. Don't take this page as professional advice, this was my first timber framing project.</p>
  <p>To enlarge a picture, just click on it.</p>
  <p>Jog to the <a href="">end</a> to see the references and a few more details.</p>

  <h1>Dug the Hole</h1>
  <p>Used an excavator to dig the initial hole into a slope. The cabin will end up facing uphill.</p>

  <img src="build/Peeled some logs.jpg" width="500" align="right" hspace="15">  
  <h1>Peeled some logs</h1>
  <p>The bark has to be peeled off the log for it to dry quicker. It also helps cut down on the insects which enjoy eating bark.</p>
  <p>In the dry heat of a Montana summer, the logs can be dry in under a year. I started the project in real late summer though. So the wood was still green when assembled.</p>
  <p> A neighbor showed me a trick to dry logs more uniformly and prevent checking, paint the ends with latex paint.Then all moisture is forced out along the logs instead of the ends. It will take much longer to dry.

  <img src="build/Posts in ground(2).jpg" width="500" align="right" hspace="15">  
  <h1>First few posts in the ground</h1>
  <p>A post hole digger is used to make a 3 foot deep hole. Then the posts are put in as level as possible. Some boarx was sprinkled into the fill material to prevent rot. The fill material is tamped hard.</p>

<article>
  <img src="build/More posts in.jpg" width="500" align="right" hspace="15">  
  <h1>Most posts in</h1>
  <p>Of the locally available timber types (Douglas Fir, Ponderosa Pine and Tamarak), Tamarak is the most rot resistant. It is best to use it for posts as they are in contact with earth.</p>
  <p>But I didn't know this and just used whatever.</p>

  <h1>All posts in</h1>
  <p> Front view of all the posts in the ground.
  <p>Note;the logs have dried a bit darker than when freshly peeled. A thin, inner layer of bark was accidentaly left. I like the darker color, but it can slow down the drying process.

  <h1>Drilling for a spike</h1>
  <p>An 18 inch long, half inch diameter drll bit is used for predrilling spike holes. It annoyingly took 2 batteries worth of charge to drill a few of these holes.</p>

  <img src="build/Central beam up.jpg" width="500" align="right" hspace="15">  
  <h1>Central beam up</h1>
  <p>Those random diagonal 2x6 boards helped as scaffoldiing to lift the heavy beams up. We could just hook it up one board at a time.</p>
  <p>This beam will be rotated so the arc is up before placing the girders on top.</p>
</article>

<article>
  <img src="build/More beams up.jpg" width="500" align="right" hspace="15">  
  <h1>More beams up</h1>
  <p>The corner posts are put in first and measured to be square and level. Then the center posts are added tobe equidistant to the corners. But you do not level the center post. You take a spare board and make sure the outside edge of the log is on the same plane as the outside edges of the corner posts.</p>
</article>

<article>
  <img src="build/More beams up(2).jpg" width="500" align="right" hspace="15">  
  <h1>More beams up(2)</h1>
  <p> The posts are spaced from center to  center at about 3ft-8in. This is because the 2x6 boards are about 92-5/8in long. The design maximizes the board usage without having to do any cutting. I decided to pop out the back wall to increase the space some without needing any more 8ft long walls. I used pretty much precisely 1 unit of lumber for this project.</p>

  <img src="build/Hammering in the longest spike.jpg" width="500" align="right" hspace="15">  
  <h1>Hammering in the longest spike</h1>
  <p>This is the only spike that goes through 3 logs. Things kept shifting around a bit, but eventually it went all the way through. In the future I'd do my notching a bit diferent so everything rests more stably.</p>

  <h1>Northside</h1>
  <p> I faced this house uphill which is East. Next time I would face the house South and just do a bit more reshaping of the hill. Solar gain makes a huge difference in winter. And in summer the morning sun makes my cabin too warm.</p>

  <img src="build/A couple windows in.jpg" width="500" align="right" hspace="15">  
  <h1>A couple windows in</h1>
  <p>I have no idea what I am doing here. I just let things happen. I leveled a sill for each window and set the window up as far outside as possible. Makes a nice shelf in front of the windows on the inside.</p>
<p>The windows I bought were $5 a piece at a reuse building supply store. Single pane with a wood frame.</p>
<p>The wood frame worked out perfectly to just send wood screws every which way into the nearby boards. A year later it still works, but I'm doing it differently from now on.</p>

  <h1>It feels like "the inside"...</h1>
  <p>It's a pretty weird feeling. Everything was outdoors. Now, all of the sudden, part of it is supposedly the inside.</p>
  <p>But yea, this was definitely the point when it no longer felt like a cow shed. I could live here.

  <h1>This ladder :/</h1>
  <p>I'm glad I no longer have to use this ladder. It worked, just weighed a crap ton and was not very stable. I was so low on wood by the end that I disassembled it to finish framing in the back wall.</p>

  <h1>Faces Uphill</h1>
  <p>This shot is taken from the east side, looking downhill towards the house. Mike Oehler's uphill patio design is his tried and true method to keep an earth bermed house dry. The first house he built is over 40 years old now. Was lucky enough to visit his property awhile back. A <a href=http://blog.woodstead.org>few pictures</a> from the trip in my blog. He also stopped by during the build process of this cabin. Rest in peace, Mike. His <a href="">book</a> is a vital resource for buildings of this type.

  <h1>A door is added</h1>
  <p>The advantage of a non-fancy door is that it is easily resized. When the house settled, the doorway got tighter and I was able to take a 1/4 inch off with the chainsaw. </p>

  <p>Cob is a natural mortar/cement sort of mixture. Its just sand, clay, and some fiber. Sometimes people use cow dung as the fiber. Others just use straw. I used cob to chink any gaps.</p>

  <p>The initial excavation was much undersized. An "uphill patio" needs to be dug to route the run-off water around the house.</p>

  <h1>Bring in the tractor</h1>
  <p>Snuck the tractor in past my tent to do some earth moving. The guy I rent the acre from includes a few hours of tractor/excavator time in the first year's rent cost. Its been super handy since all of us living here are building our own dwellings.</p>
  <p>That bike got me and my gear to the property from Amtrak 140miles away. It was my only transportation during the build. Glad my neighbors let me tag along into town many a time.</p>

  <h1>FAQ</h1>
  <h3>How long did it take</h3>
    <p>Collecting materials and brainstorming the design took about a month. I think from putting the first post in to having a door installed was about 3 weeks. Thats about when I started sleeping in it. Although, it is an ongoing project. I didnt have heat, a floor, or electricity for the first several months.</p>
  <h3>How much did it cost</h3>
    <p>Including lumber, fasteners, windows, door, and woodstove I  was under $500. Ive spent a bit more over the year touching things up and adding solar. I dont know an exact amount.</p>
  <h3>Whats the floor like</h3>
    <p>For the first few months it was just dirt. Now I finished most of it with wood. And I did an "earthen" part around the wood stove. An earthen floor can be just tamped dirt with linseed oil mixed in. It cured really hard. Other people online have fancy complicated methods. But I tend to look at a procedure of 30steps and delete 27 of them (probably why my beer is no good).</p>
  <h3>Legalities</h3>
    <p>Many rural counties have no building codes. Where I built this doesn't.</p>
